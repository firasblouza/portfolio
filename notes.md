# general ideas

- create react app is dead so you should try to switch to vite or nextjs
- you shouldd add a max width to your sections
- try to tweak the colors 
- make the about me text a bit bigger on large screens
- try to add a reveal animation fot each section

# code improvements

- App.js is a mess xD:
 - you should avoid using document in react (you have to sometimes but usually there are better solutions)
 - code is hard to read: 
  - unclear function names (skillsLetsConnect)
  - you should try to seperate code blocks either by using spaces or exporting some functions into their own files

# positive notes

- Mobile view looks perfect ðŸ‘Œ
